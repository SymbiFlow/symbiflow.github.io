    <h1 id="symbiflow-google-season-of-docs">SymbiFlow - Google Season of Docs</h1>
<p>Google Season of Docs is a program aiming to expand the reach of open source
by bringing together open source and technical writers communities, with good
documentation being a primary facilitating factor in this process. As part of
the program we are looking for ambitious technical writers who would like to
use this opportunity to get involved in our open source FPGA toolchain project,
SymbiFlow, and contribute to work that will revolutionize the FPGA landscape
by enabling new, more software-oriented workflows and more vendor-neutral,
collaborative, modular and open development.</p>
<h2 id="step-0-prior-reading">Step 0 - Prior reading</h2>
<p>It is best to start off by reading the Google Season of Docs
<a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs">Introduction</a>,

participation. This is where you can register as a technical writer for
